Keeping track of programming knowledge that I pick up each day.

#Git
* git checkout -: Checkout the last branch you had checked out.

#Angular
* ngStrictDi: Enforce strict dependency injection through array syntax in your Angular apps.  This is particularly useful for ensuring your code doesn't break under minification.  Usage:
    * <div ng-app="myApp" ng-strict-di></div>
    * angular.bootstrap(elementToAttachTo, "myApp", {strictDi: true})
