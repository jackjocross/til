Keeping track of programming knowledge that I pick up each day.

#Git
* git checkout -: Checkout the last branch you had checked out.
* git fetch, git checkout <branch name>: Checkout a remote branch in your repository.
* git reset --hard HEAD: throw away any changes you have made and reset to the head of the current branch you are on.
* git push origin --delete <branch name>: Delete a remote git branch.
* git remote prune origin: Prune stale, unreachable branches from your local repo.
* Git Hooks: Git hooks allow you to run a script before or after specific git events.  Some events you can hook into are post-update, pre-commit, pre-push, pre-rebase, and pre-applypatch.  Hooks are stored in the .git/hooks folder of your local repo and are not tracked by git.  In addition to these local hooks, there are also the pre-receive, update, and post-receive hooks which live on the server.
* git rebase -i ~HEAD(x): Can be used to squash the last x commits together into one.  This is useful if you have many commits on a certain branch but want to make your history more concise.  Squashing commits will combine the changes from several commits into one to keep your history readable.
* Git attributes: Allow you to apply specific merge functions, filter functions, and diff flags to a certain file or glob.  Attributes:
    * filter=myFilterFunc, where myFilterFunc handles the clean and/or smudge functions
    * merge=myMergeFunc, where my merge specifies how to merge the file such as taking only ours changes.
    * -diff (binary diff flag)
* Git config: there are three places that git will look for a config file, ~/.gitconfig, $GIT_DIR/config, and $(prefix)/git/config.  The order of precedence goes from global to local so the config in your $GIT_DIR will take the highest precedence.  Git config files are not in a location that can be tracked and used automatically, this is for security reasons.  Each user of a repo will have to manually setup their config file or reference an example config that is tracked.
* git reflog --oneline: This command will let you srr all of your git actions displayed concisely with their hash, head number, and description.  From there you can pick a specific point in time to revert to if you have dug yoursef into a hole.
* --no-verify: Allows you to skip any client side git hooks you have added.  For instance if you have a hook to run unit tests bedore pushing, this will allow you to skip the tests.

#Angular
* ngStrictDi: Enforce strict dependency injection through array syntax in your Angular apps.  This is particularly useful for ensuring your code doesn't break under minification.  Usage:
    * <div ng-app="myApp" ng-strict-di></div>
    * angular.bootstrap(elementToAttachTo, "myApp", {strictDi: true})
* angular.bootstrap(elementToAttachTo, "myApp"): Used to manually bootstrap Angular applications without explicitly attaching ng-app to any DOM element.  It can also be used to declare two ng-apps on one page.  There can only be one explicit ng-app attached to a DOM element on a page but you can manually bootstrap an Angular app to any number of elements.
* $emit() vs. $broadcast(): Emit and broadcast are the two ways you can fire events in Angular.  The difference is that emit will only notify $rootScope listeners while broadcast will start by notifying $rootScope listeners and fanning the event out to all of the children of $rootScope.  This makes emit a more efficient choice in some cases.
* $q.all([promise1, promise2]): Using the $q module you can wait on multiple promises to return before .then() is called.  The argument to the .then() function will be an array of responses from the promises.
* Transclude: Transclusion in Angular can be used to prevent a directive from completely replacing it's inner HTML.  By adding transclude: true to the directive definition and including the ngTransclude directive in the directive's template, Angular will replace the ngTranclude directive with the inner HTML of your directive.  The transcluded HTML will receive the scope of your directive's parent element.  You can also provide an object as the transclude parameter of your directive.  The object should contain a key referencing the directive that you want to transclude and ng-transclude will inject that directive instead of just the inner HTML.
* Importing other apps into a module: If you have created an Angular app which you want to use in another Angular app, you can do so by simply including the app name in your module definition:
    angular.module('myNewApp', ['myCoolReusableApp']);
You can now use any directives, controllers or services in myCoolReusableApp.  This is also what is going on when you use libraries such as angular-animate.
* App initialization order: config, services/factories, controllers, links.

#React
* this.setState(stateObj): Used to update the state of a component.  This will trigger a render() which will then update the display of the component if there are differences between the DOM and shadow DOM.
* propTypes: React propTypes allow you to do some amount of type checking in your application.  propTypes will define what type of variable your component is expecting, if it is required or not, and will throw an error if the conditions are not met.  Example:
    React.createClass({
        propTypes: {
            prop1: React.propTypes.array,
            prop2: React.propTypes.bool.isRequired,
            prop3: React.proptypes.node
        }
    });
* defaultProps: Allow you to declare default values for your component properties in case none are passed in.
* Reselect: A library that can be used with React in order to create memoized functions that can be used to create derived data.  This can increase the performance of your React application by preventing unnecessary rerenders and only performing expensive calculations when the state has actually changed.

#Redux
* combineReducers: Combines multiple reducer functions into one so that you can more easily modularize your reducers and still pass in just the state object.

#Immutable
* fromJS: Deeply creates an immutable object.
* Map: Shallowly creates an immutable object.
* toJS: returns the native JavaScript version of the immutable object.

#Webpack
* file-loader: A Webpack loader that can be used to include static asset files such as images or fonts in your bundle.
* json-loader: A Webpack loader that should be included to load JSON files such as mocks into your bunde.

#Node
* nvm (Node version manager): can be used to easily switch between running different versions of Node and NPM for each shell window.  Use "nvm install ${version}" to install and use a specific Node version and "nvm use ${version}" to switch between available versions.  "nvm ls -remote" lists all Node versions available for download.

#JavaScript
* bind(context, ...args): Applied to a function, sets the functions "this" to be equal to context.  Prepends ...args as arguments to the function when it is called.  Usage:
    * myFunction.bind(null, "myParam")
      myFunction();
* String.slice(start, stop) vs. String.substring(start, stop):
    * If start > stop, substring will swap the two values where as slice will not.
    * If start or stop is negative or NaN in substring it will be treated as zero.
    * If start is negative in slice, it will start from the end of the string.
    * If stop is negative in slice, it will set stop to (string.length - 1) - Math.abs(stop).
* Array.map(fn): Applies fn to each element of the array, returns the new array with fn(Array[n]) for each element n in the original array.
* Array.filter(fn): Runs fn on each argument in the array, removing the elements for which fn(array[n]) returns false and creating a new array.
* Truthy vs. falsey: Javascript expressions evaluate to truthy or falsey which can then be used to determine the branch taken in the code.  Since there are only six falsey values in Javascript (undefined, null, NaN, 0, "", and false) the best way to test for truthiness is to test for not falseyness.  Objects always evaluate to truthy so you have to be careful for odd examples like 'new Number(0)' and 'new Boolean(false)' which both evaluate to truthy.
* Native DOM node removal: if you need to remove an element from the DOM without the help of jQuery, you can use:
    let nodeToRemove = document.getElementById('myId');
    nodeToRemove.parentNode.removeChild(nodeToRemove)
* sparse vs. dense arrays: Sparse arrays are arrays where some of the items in the array do not exist, eg. [1, , 2] or [, , ,].  Sparse arrays can be creared with the array constructor Array(3) and the nonexistent items are not iterable.  Dense arrays are arrays where all of the items exist eg. [1, 2, 3].  All of the items in a dense array are iterable.
* Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor): This method can be used to define properties on the obj passed in which have specific characteristics according to the descriptor object.  For instance, passing in the descriptor {writable: false} will create a read-only property on the object.
* arguments: An array-like object containing each function argument that is a local variable of each function.  It does not have array properties such as length or pop, but you can turn the arguments object into an array using Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) or [...arguments].  You can also access the callee and caller of the function using arguments.callee and arguments.caller respectively.
* typeof: Returns the type of a JavaScript variable as a string.  Possible types are string, number, object, undefined, null, array

##ES6
* Object Destructuring: in ES6 we no longer have to use dot notation to pull out the properties of an object that we want to use, instead we can do:
    let {prop} = obj;
And now prop will be equql to the prop property of object.  We can also do this with more than one property at once like so:
    let {prop1, prop2, prop3} = obj.
This syntax is much more concise and gives us a simple way to clean up code.  Object destructuring can also take a default argument in case the value is undefined on the object:
    let {prop1 = 10} = obj
* let: Variables declared with let are bracket scoped as opposed to variables declared with var which are functionally scoped.
* const: Variables declared with const are also bracket scoped but in addition they can only be written to once otherwise they will throw an error.
* Object.assign(target, ...sources): Used to copy the values of all own enumerable properties from the sources objects to the target, returns the new target object.  Uses the Get of sources and Put of target. 
* Template strings: 'Hello ${worldVar}'.  The variable or expression inside ${} will be replaced with the result of the toString() method called on it.
* Mulitline Strings: Using backtick string notation, ES6 supports multiline strings which will evaluate to include the newline character and any extra tabbing.
* Arrow functions: (input) => { //code in here }.  A concise way to represent functions, especially when used inline or in combination with map, filter, reduce.  Arrow functions also share their this with their parent.
* for-of loop: The for of loop is new to Javascript in ES6 and loops over an iterable assigning each enumerated item while looping.  You can convert data structures to iterablea using the entries(), keys(), or values() functions.  Example:
    let x = [1, 2, 3];
    for (let item of x.entries()) {
        console.log(item)
    }
* import: Used to include dependencies from other JavaScript files.  If you use { specificObject } after import you will receive what was exported as specificObject.  Otherwise if you do not use brackets you will receive whatever was exported using default.
* export: Used to make code accessible as a dependency to other JavaScript files.  If the default keyword is used the object will be the default export.  Otherwise the object will have to be referenced by name in the import.
* get/set: If get and set functions are defined for properties of a class, those functions will be used when accessing or assigning the variable.

#NPM
*shrinkwrap: Run using "npm shrinkwrap --dev".  This will create a npm-shrinkwrap.json file which will be used to resolve all of the npm dependencies and sub-dependencies in your package.json.  This can prevent unwanted and breaking updates to packages that can come through the use of the ~, ^, and * modifiers in your package.json and the package.json of any of your dependencies.  

#CSS
* :nth-child(pattern): Pseudo class which applies to elements which are the nth child of their parent according to the pattern.  The pattern can simply be a number or can be more complex such as "n + 2".  The childrens index starts at 1.  Usage:
    * :nth-child(n + 2):nth-child(-n + 3) - Selects all elements from the second up until the third to last.
* pointer-events: none | visible | painted...: Property which specifies when a particular element should respond to mouse events.  Setting to "none" comes in handy when you have an element which does not have any click functionality overlapping an element which does.  It will allow the underlying element to handle the click even if the overlapping element is clicked.
* calc(expression): Calc will set values for attributes such as height and width to the result of expression.  Expression can use +, -, *, / as well as percentage and pixel values.  This can be useful to take into account percentage and pixels such as:
    .class-name { 
        height: calc(20% + 10px);
    }
* css-modules: This npm package can be used to create locally scoped css and remove the need for systems like BEM that were needed to overcome the difficulties of CSS being globally scoped.  A set of styles can be included in your JavaScript component using "let styles = import './mystyles.css';".  Then in your tenplates the CSS class can be injected using "styles.myClassName".  css-modules will generate a unique class name for your component that will prevent naming conflicts.
* BEM: A CSS pattern which stands for block, element, modifier.  UI elements are split into blocks, elements within those blocks, and modifiers to represent conditional states.  Class names are then written block__element--modifier so that a minimal amount of nested stylings are used.  This can be useful to reduce the competition for specificity that can result from two nested styles competing for the same element.
* > selector: This selector can be used like so: A > B {} and refers to any element B that is a child (direct descendant) of A.
* @extend: A SASS mixin which allows you to create selectors which inherit from other selectors.  This can be useful to create more object oriented CSS and reduce the amount of code written.
* attribute selectors: In CSS you can select HTML elements according the presenence of a certain attribute.  Elements can be selected solely based on presence ([attr]) or can be selected based on the value of the attribute ([attr=value]).  Elements can also be selected according to a matching function such as prefix ([attr^=value]) or ([attr*=value]).

#SASS
* maps: Sass maps can be used to group together like properties and use getters to retrieve them.  Nested maps can also utilized by definining custom deep getter functions.  Example:
    $props: (
        myCoolProp: "10px"
    );

#HTML
* script - async and defer:  By default, the DOM parser will load script tags synchronously.  This means that if you have a script tag that takes abnormally long to fetch, the rest of the page that comes after your script tag will not load until the tag is fetched and parsed.  Adding async to the script tag will allow the parser to continue parsing the rest of the page and handle the script tag once it is fetched.  The defer tag will also allow the page to continue parsing and then will process the script once the DOM parsing is completed.  However, if you have a document.write call inside the loading script, the page could render incorrectly if you use async or defer.
* disable: This tag can be added to an input to prevent it from being accessed or selected.  One example is when using placeholder text for a <select> element, adding disabled to the placeholder <option> will prevent it from being selected as an actual value.
* target: For <a> elements you can specify that the link opens in a new tab by adding a target="_blank" attribute.
* pushState, replaceState: These methods on the history object allow you to add and update entries in the browser history.  Each of these methods takes a state object, a title, and a url.  The state object is anything that can be serialized and is used when the popstate event is fired for the state.  The title string is currently ignored.  The URL is the URL stored in the browser.  This URL will not be loaded when the state methods are called but could be called later if the page reloads.
* localstorage vs. cookies: localstorage can be used to store data on the client from page load to page load.  A cookie can also be used for some of the same purposed but the main difference is that cookies are automatically passed back and forth from the server.  If the part of the application that needs access to the persistent data lives on the server, cookies are probably the way to go.  If the client side application needs the data, you shouldnt waste bandwidth passing the cookies back and forth on each request.

#Regular Expressions
####Regular expressions can be used to verify that strings match a certain pattern.  One useful application is input validation.  
* ?: Denotes that the previous expression is optional
* \character: represents the literal of the character
* {n, k}: Denotes that between n and k repetitions of the previous expression are allowed
* [1-9]: Any number between 1 and 9 is allowed
* | : Marks alternate possibilities that are allowed

#Chrome Dev Tools
*Blackboxing: If you navigate to Dev Tools > Settings > Blackboxing you will be able to add URI patterns for files to be blackboxed.  This will prevent chrome from outputting information about the internals of the file.  One use case is if you have a custom logger and all of your logging line numbers are listed as coming from inside the logger.  If you blackbox the logger script you will see the line numbers displayed as what line the custom logger was cqlled from, which is usually more useful.

#Shell
* alias commands: If you have a long command that you type repeatedly you can create a shortcut by adding an alias to your shell configuration file (e.g. ~/.zshrc).  Example:
    alias hr="git reset --hard head"
